# webp-converter
A hacky bash script that uses cwebp to handle bulk converting of jpg and png images. Also has a python script to handle changing of image colors from 'CMYK' to 'RGB' before running the webp conversion. The bash script loops through parent and child directories and creates webp versions of any jpg and png images. Retains names and folder structures.
